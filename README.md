# 👋 Hi, I'm John Jimmy

🎓 Final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student under KTU  
💻 Passionate about **software development**, **embedded systems**, and **AI/ML**  
🔧 Currently building projects using **Python**, **YOLOv11**, **ESP32**, and **Jetson Nano**

---

## 🚀 Projects

- 🛣️ **AI Road Sign Detection System**  
  AI-based signboard detection and classification system deployed on Jetson Orin Nano using YOLOv11.  
  Custom-trained datasets, real-time Pi camera input, and voice alerts for drivers.  
  *(Code coming soon)*

- 📡 **M-ary PSK Image Transmission**  
  Python simulation of M-PSK modulation and demodulation for images over an AWGN channel.  
  Includes BER/SER analysis and image reconstruction for M = 2, 4, 8.  
  *(Code coming soon)*

- 📊 **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Simulation**  
  Python implementation of PCM with quantization, SQNR analysis, and signal reconstruction.  
  Visual results with plots for different signal configurations.  
  *(Code coming soon)*

- 🪖 **Helmet Detection System with ESP32 and MQTT**  
  Embedded vision system that captures images via ESP32 and transmits them to Raspberry Pi using MQTT protocol.  
  Raspberry Pi processes the image to detect helmet usage and triggers alerts for non-compliance.  
  *(Code coming soon)*
