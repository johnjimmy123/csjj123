## 🚀 Projects

- 🛣️ **AI Road Sign Detection System**  
  AI-based signboard detection and classification system deployed on Jetson Orin Nano using YOLOv11.  
  Custom-trained datasets, real-time camera input, and voice alerts for drivers.  
  *(Code coming soon)*

- 📡 **M-ary PSK Image Transmission**  
  Python simulation of M-PSK modulation and demodulation for images sent over an AWGN channel.  
  Includes BER/SER plots and image reconstruction for M = 2, 4, 8.  
  *(Code coming soon)*

- 📊 **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Simulation**  
  Python implementation of quantization, SQNR analysis, and signal reconstruction using PCM.  
  Visual graphs and parameter comparisons included.  
  *(Code coming soon)*

- 🪖 **Helmet Detection System**  
  Embedded system using Raspberry Pi and ESP32 with MQTT protocol to detect helmet usage.  
  Processes image from ESP32 and sends alerts for violations.  
  *(Code coming soon)*
